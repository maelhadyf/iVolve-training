# Lab 27: Updating Applications and Rolling Back Changes

Deploy NGINX with 3 replicas.  
Create a service to expose NGINX deployment and use port forwarding to access NGINX service locally.  
Update NGINX image in the deployment to Apache image.  
View deployment's rollout history.  
Roll back NGINX deployment to the previous image version and Monitor pod status to confirm successful rollback.
