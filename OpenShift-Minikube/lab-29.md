## Lab 29: Storage Configuration
Create a deployment named my-deployment with 1 replica using the NGINX image.  
Exec into the NGINX pod and create a file at /usr/share/nginx/html/hello.txt with the content hello, this is <your-name>.  
verify the file is served by NGINX using curl localhost/hello.txt.  
Delete the NGINX pod and wait for the deployment to create a new pod  
Exec into the new pod and verify the file at /usr/share/nginx/html/hello.txt is no longer present.  
Create a PVC and modify the deployment to attach the PVC to the pod at /usr/share/nginx/html.  
Repeat the previous steps and Verify the file persists across pod deletions.  
Make a Comparison between PV, PVC, and StorageClass.

### StorageClass

- Acts like a storage template or blueprint
- Defines the type and configuration of storage that can be dynamically provisioned
- Enables automatic creation of Persistent Volumes when needed
- Think of it as a "menu" of available storage options in your cluster

### Persistent Volume (PV)

- The actual storage resource in the cluster
- Like a pre-allocated piece of storage
- Can be provisioned either:
  - **Statically** (manually created by admin)
  - **Dynamically** (automatically created via StorageClass)
- Independent of any specific pod's lifecycle

### Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)

- A request for storage by a user/pod
- Acts as a bridge between pods and PVs
- Specifies requirements like:
  - How much storage is needed
  - What access modes are required
  - Which StorageClass to use

### Here's a simple analogy:

- **StorageClass** is like a hotel room type (e.g., standard, deluxe, suite)
- **PV** is like the actual hotel room
- **PVC** is like a room reservation
